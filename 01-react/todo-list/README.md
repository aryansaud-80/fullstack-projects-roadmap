# ✅ Todo List App – React (Beginner Project)

This is a beginner-friendly **Todo List App** built using **React + Vite**. It's the first step in my roadmap to rebuild my MERN skills from scratch with real, hands-on projects.

- Add new todos
- Edit and update existing todos
- Mark as completed/uncompleted
- Delete todos
- Filter ( All , Active, Completed)
- Clear Completed Todo on one Go
- Persist data using localStorage

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

- To **revisit React basics** (state, props, component logic)
